 it's funny You dont know how the world works.

Please read propaganda by bernays and watch century of self.

But yes tell us more how it is okay for then to pull stupid stuff, say horrible things and it be a joke, do horribly racist political cartoons of serena William's. But someone posts a funny pic of kavanagh and clearly Democrats are the evil of all evils and that is why trump got elected. Not because trump used fear of the other to get votes, or said literally everything his base wanted to hear.

The truth is if the people that voted for trump get pissed at this or a political cartoon of trump but are okay with one of Obama or serena williams.
It doesnt fucking matter what we would do, they wont come to our side.

And signed affidavit or know you kind of cant prove what is going on through their head at that exact moment soooo it could be misleading, it could not. But it is still funny. So in the words of conservatives frow a sense of humor maybe?

 &gt;I don't think your claims are borne out by time use surveys of the general population or time use surveys of the unemployed specifically. The average American watches a staggering 4+ hours of TV per day, and plenty of other time on leisure activities, not work. 

Yes, *because they are also at work*. I'm not saying people want 40 hour + work weeks. Please look up some statistics on unemployment and happyness.

&gt;There is a large gulf between fancy cars and food on the table. Making $12/hr (Walmart Full Time Average) over min wage is the difference between a 2BR and a 1BR, the difference between clothing from good will and clothing from Walmart, from a $300 phone and a $50 phone. I would not say that someone who lives in a small apartment with a cheap phone and wears used clothing is somehow living an awful life - most of the quality of life is your social network.

I don't think it's open to dispute that rising income is correlated with happyness as well. And you know what makes you feel like shit? Feeling like you're not self sufficient. Feeling like you depend on welfare. Again, plenty of statistics out there.

Yeah, maybe it's the difference between a 300$ phone and a 50$ phone for some. But it's also the difference between a car with a cracked windshield or not. Buying a new mattress because yours is 20 years old. Fixing the lampshade that's been broken since you've moved in. Not to even mention that Walmart tries *very* hard not having to employ people full time. *Half* of Walmarts employees don't work full time, and that's not because they don't want to, or because that's "normal" because of the industry it's in, no, it hasn't always been that way, it hasn't even been that way 10 years ago. And part time workers get less money, less benefits and have a harder time climbing the ranks.

&gt;You don't think Walmart's labor market is governed by supply and demand? How does this strange claim turn SNAP benefits into a subsidy?

I have told you why. Walmart acts as a monopsony, and the workers affected by these issues are very inelastic in their labor supply.

Another thing is that you *have to work* to get food stamps, if you are able to work. For at least 20 hours per week, too, btw. So, you have a situation where you can't just *not work* but the only place where you *can* work is Walmart. Your options *aren't* working and earning a bit more, or just staying at home and living off benefits. Your options are either working and earning a tiny wage in addition to food stamps, or not having work or food stamps. Do you really think that's a position where the employee can be picky about wages?

 &gt;But you're saying no, goal just means consistent action or something like that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This is why I didn't want to open this can of worms. Please stop misrepresenting my position. You can easily scroll back up and read what I wrote.

okay, lets scroll up: " It just is a goal. Any outcome of any action is potentially a goal. When something is always acting to effect *the same outcome* that is what a goal is. Gravity acts, every time it acts, to effect the same outcome. "

That's what you said. Something with a goal is something that effects the same outcome. So its a consistent action? I don't see how I misrepresented you.

&gt;If gravity is "just doing things," it isn't acting *towards an outcome*, it's just doing things.

The thing its doing is pulling things together. That's it. Why does that require a mind?

&gt;If there were no mind directing gravity, however, it would be "just doing things," without any sort of goal because it has no mind in itself.

The thing It would be doing is pulling things together. What's the problem?

&gt;Something has to determine what the goal is *before* things can start acting towards the goal. Otherwise those things are just acting randomly, and they *will not* effect the same outcome each time, nor even try to.

Why? why can't a thing just do the same action every time without a mind behind it?

You're saying "well because if there was no mind behind it, it wouldn't do the same thing every time", more or less.

Bu that's what I'm asking you to demonstrate. All you did was rephrase it.

You need to actually lay out an argument for this.

 Right.. the treasury should print money to stimulate aggregate demand adequately, and the Fed should buy bonds to control interest rates adequately.

You're right, this is exactly what is happening.

And what is the problem, exactly?

We are doing what Trump said we should do, which is also what MMT/post-Keynesian (**AKA sane** economic theory) says we should do, so what is the problem??

The problem is, of course, that the fiscal stimulus could be much better targeted than it is. *But it is still better than no fiscal stimulus*, so shouldn't we be marveling at how well Trump has played politics to get the Republic party to be Keynesian?

**It's really astonishing, honestly.** Before 2016, neither the Republicans or the Democrats were Keynesian. The Republicans were basicaly Monetarists, and the Democrats were New-Keynesians. AKA, both parties were essentially neoliberal.

Now we have a political party that is actually Keynesian, and lo and behold, good economic policy is actually working well.

How will the Democrats react?

Edit: Just, really, anyone who wants to downvote, explain why? It's so frustrating, as someone who's not in either stupid camp, who actually thinks about these things impartially... What is wrong with the point that Trump's fiscal stimulus is better than no fiscal stimulus? What is wrong with that point? Please explain.

 Hey Peeps,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm interested in MTL vaping right now and have chosen my RDA to use (Berserker from Vandy Vape).  I am asking what kind of juice is best for MTL setup.  I currently vape 9mg on RDA's and 50mg Salt in pods.

&amp;#x200B;

Can I use the same 50mg salt in this setup and expect similar effect,  should I use a higher freebase nic (like 12 or 18mg), or would a 6mg salt be better?

&amp;#x200B;

Please and Thank You.

Out of curiosity, how is the quality of the image on the mat? Card art is pretty small, I’d be worried about it not being as crisp. Could you send me a photo?
