 You're looking at the ''text'', not the meaning - the whole thing as written is nonsense, but this Higgins was both a Druid and a phallic-obsessed joker - everything in this has a double meaning. This is a guy who was a follower of Tolands, would have known about both Pantheism and Deism (and don't forget, Toland wrote cryptically about Pantheism for many years out of fear of getting found out), using a term that we know has absolutely ''nothing to do'' with any religions ranging from Medea to India... so what does it really mean? Why would a man in Higgins position make up a word like that, and use it as he does? --

 And as you can see, there is nothing to block for and no reason for you to follow me around looking for stuff.  Your unblock had more to do with your desire to wheel war with WMC rather than anything to do with me.  Please study [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User_talk:DHeyward#Mess] and simply leave me alone.  It's not hard.  Don't read my talk page.  If you really want to help with 3RR or edit warring, patrol the noticeboards.   --

 You [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Pet_Shop_Boys_discography&action=historysubmit&diff=420346282&oldid=420339952 removed an image again] saying that it violates [[WP:FU]]. Did You actually look at the image? How did You come to the conclusion that this is a Fair use image? Did You ever check the image's licensing? Even after being reverted and given notice You still claimed it as a fair use image. So do You always revert without verifying the factuality of Your action? As an admin I would have expected more diligence. Please explain.

 Comparing Uma Thurman's other movies to the Batman film series is really apples and oranges.  The last time that I checked, ''Kill Bill'' or ''Pulp Fiction'' isn't a major, multi-billion dollar comic book movie franchise.  And what else is there supposed to be in the templates?  You don't want to know more info about the directors, writers, composers, producers, effects crew, etc.?  There's more to the movies beyond the actors and the movies themselves.  Look at the ''big picture''!

 You are talking to the wrong person.  I really don't know what to tell you.  I just know there is a bot that categorizes them as orphaned articles needing orphan tags.  Go to http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Orphan#Suggestions_for_how_to_de-orphan_an_article  Both Lonelypages and Untagged Orphans are finding them and putting them on their lists.  Please discuss it with them.  All I know is that they are showing up as meeting the criteria for orphan tags.  And as I said in my orphan summaries, as long as they show up there, I will tag them as orphans.  How to NOT get them listed as needing a tag is something I know nothing about.

 Dear Juan, Thank you for your post. I am not an administrator and I also do not have any interest in becoming embroiled in the dispute(s) currently going on at the [[Tom van Flandern]] article.  I simply responded to a post on the Wikiquette page [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts\/archive98#Tom_Van_Flandern]. Wikiquette, as you know, is a public forum where any editor(s) may post concerns and receive feed back or advice from the general community. In response to the Wikiquette post I looked at the TVF talk page and felt that you had made some incivil remarks on the talk page and I brought this to your attention on your User Page and made a note of this on the Wikiquette page.  If you feel that my assessment of your behavior is incorrect, then you may ignore my advice and continue as you have been. I have no intention of taking the matter further. I understand that you are frustrated with the situation on that article and that English may not be your first language. However, I would remind you that disputes over content are not an excuse for incivil behavior, so please keep that in mind going forward. If you have issues concerning the behavior of other editors then you should investigate the various dispute resolution options which are outlined [[WP:DR|here]]. I'm sorry you are having problems with this article.  Keep in mind that one option is to just walk away from the article for awhile and let things cool down. Good luck to you.--<span style=\"font-family:Comic Sans MS,sans -serif\"> \u2014

 Hi Acalamari. Good morning. Can you please help me with [[User talk:Efe#New TK Article - Need Help]]. The editor once created [[TradeKey]] but was deleted under G11. I assisted him to write it first in a sandbox, and also provided him with pertinent links. However, he just said he is working for the company. This is person is nice but I am afraid of the COI and can't handle the matter this week coz I am attending a confab. Thank you. --

 Hi PM800, thanks for the quick response. The issue I was trying to raise was that the quotation in the sentence \"The lyrics are about \"the occasional problem of drunken male impotence.\"[3]\" doesn't appear to match the reference that follows it. Could you double-check that this quotation is contained within that source? I didn't see it, and a Google search suggested it belonged to a separate John Harris book, but it's possible I'm just mistaken. Once that's cleared up, I think the hook itself is fine, but since it depends on this reference, I want to make sure it's accurate. Nice expansion on this, btw.

 Good afternoon (or whatever part of the day you are observing), William!  I've noticed you populating the [[:Category:Russian-language surnames]], and I am not quite grasping how it is different from the recently deleted Category:Russian surnames.  Could you, please, point me to the place where the new category scheme is being discussed; I would much like to follow its development and\/or study its outcomes.  Thanks in advance!\u2014
